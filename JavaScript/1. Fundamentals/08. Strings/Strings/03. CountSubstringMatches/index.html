        Write a JavaScript function that finds how many times a substring is<br />
        contained in a given text (perform case insensitive search).<br />
        Example: The target substring is "in". The text is as follows:<br /><br />
        We are living in an yellow submarine. We don't have anything else.<br />
        Inside the submarine is very tight. So we are drinking all the day.<br />
        We will move out of it in 5 days.<br />
        The result is: 9
