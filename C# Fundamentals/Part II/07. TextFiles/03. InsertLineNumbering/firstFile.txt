In computing, the term stream is 
used in a number of ways, in all 
cases referring to a sequence of
data elements made available over
time. A stream can be thought of
as a conveyor belt that allows 
items to be processed one at a 
time rather than in large batches.
On Unix and related systems based
on the C language, a stream is a 
source or sink of data, usually
individual bytes or characters.
Streams are an abstraction used 
when reading or writing files,
or communicating over network 
sockets. The standard streams
are three streams made available
to all programs. Pipelines can 
also be understood as streams as 
well as any unlimited (non-packaged) 
information that is inserted by 
a device. 
	In the Scheme language and
some others, a stream is a lazily
evaluated or delayed sequence of
data elements. A stream can be 
used similarly to a list, but
later elements are only calculated
when needed. Streams can therefore
represent infinite sequences and
series.
